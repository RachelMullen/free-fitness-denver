  Join your friends in a beautiful 5K walk, jog or run that showcases our awesome neighborhoods (Denver, Olde Town Arvada, and Rosedale) and reward yourself with your favorite small batch brew after.
  
  We start promptly at 6:30pm, so plan enough time to find parking and sign the waiver (for first timers only).
  
  This is a year-round run club, so come prepared with warm layers, reflective gear and/or headlamps on fall and winter evenings.",
